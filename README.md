# LDA-modeling and Parsing Json file
In here I parsed JSON datasets.Then I used pre-processing techniques to clean text data. I am learning to apply LDA modeling next.

# Topic modeling
LDAâ€™s approach to topic modeling is it considers each document as a collection of topics in a certain proportion. And each topic as a collection of keywords, again, in a certain proportion. It rearranges the topics distribution within the documents and keywords distribution within the topics to obtain a good composition of topic-keywords distribution. A topic is nothing but a collection of dominant keywords that are typical representatives. Just by looking at the keywords, you can identify what the topic is all about
